# Data-structures-SDP-2019-2020
Some exercises and C++ Data Structures Project 

This is a project I made for my Data stuctures class. We were given projects to choose from and I chose The Labyrinth. The Labyrinth was a maze-like game which included a few types of characters all of whom had a different way of traversing the maze. The game included a file with levels, a function that checked if the level was passable(whether or not there was a path from the start to the end of the maze), three characters to choose from and a monster. I researched the different algorithms used in graph traversal and how to implement them on my matrix.
